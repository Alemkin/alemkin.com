									<p>For as long as this nation has been around, there have always been class and race 
									divisions that lead to unfortunate situations for the youth of this country to get 
									equal opportunity in education. That goes especially for those in inner city environments, 
									as there is a general trend of declined economic state of an area and its educational system. 
									There has been a lot of research into the observation of these situations, but not a lot of solutions
									to the problem. It takes more than just the people in the situation, it takes society as a whole 
									to care for all education of children collectively, and work together to solve this dilemma. </p>
									<p>This project hits a personal note as I have experienced first-hand what it is like
									to be in circumstances beyond your control. A good bit of diversity can be helpful at times, 
									but being in a situation where there is no escape is as much harm as you could do to a child.
									I was lucky in that my mother was able to continue finding success and I had certain motivations
									that lead to better opportunities. However, unless exposed to some type of positive reinforcement
									of learning, there is little hope for betterment of the child in the future.
									If both home and school are broken in terms of encouragement, then the chance of the child
									finding the motivation within themselves is slim to none.</p>

								<h1>Service Learning
								</h1>
								</header>
									<p>I completed my service learning project over the course of
									two volunteering tutoring sessions and one community engagement
									project with inner city children at a recreation and learning center. </p>

									<p><div class=image><img src="images/transform.jpg" alt="Transforming Children"></div>
									</br>The first engagement I attended, was the Transforming Children and Families, in which 
									I interacted with children up to the age of 18 that attended schools in 
									the area. I was there to provide insight and perspective on my experiences 
									as a college student, how I got where I am, and what they can do to get 
									there as well. It was really a valuable experience talking to these kids,
									as I do enjoy interacting with children, and watching immediate engagement 
									from many children, as well as slow but sure opening of those that were more shy. 
									They all had genuine interests and I wholly enjoyed fanning those interests and 
									talking in depth with them about what they wanted to do and how they wanted to
									get there, as well as how I've experienced some of these passions in my lifetime.
									This experience both showed the kids that other people do care about their well 
									being and future, outside of their immediate family and friends, and that there
									are people willing to help. </p>
									
									
									
									<p><div class=image><img src="images/page15.jpg" alt="Page 15 Tutoring"></div>
									The next two were at a community project called Page 15 Tutoring, 
									where students from around the area came in after school at different intervals,
									allowing us to help guide them through their various projects and homework assignments
									to be completed. It was enlightening to interact with so many children coming of their 
									own volition to this free tutoring center, that provides computer and internet access, 
									as well as a plethora of books and comics to read. They were all so lively and interested 
									in what they did, and there were gems that shone through as those that have the strive
									to learn as much as they can and were open to the idea of getting help beyond themselves. 
									I really loved every experience I had with all of these children in tutoring and life advice. </p>
