									<p>	For as long as this nation has been around, there have always been class and race 
									divisions that lead to unfortunate situations for the youth of this country to get 
									equal opportunity in education. That goes especially for those in inner city environments, 
									as there is a general trend of declined economic state of an area and its educational system. 
									There has been a lot of research into the observation of these situations, but not a lot of solutions
									to the problem. It takes more than just the people in the situation, it takes society as a whole 
									to care for all education of children collectively, and work together to solve this dilemma. </p>
									<p>	This project hits a personal note as I have experienced first-hand what it is like
									to be in circumstances beyond your control. A good bit of diversity can be helpful at times, 
									but being in a situation where there is no escape is as much harm as you could do to a child.
									I was lucky in that my mother was able to continue finding success and I had certain motivations
									that lead to better opportunities. However, unless exposed to some type of positive reinforcement
									of learning, there is little hope for betterment of the child in the future.
									If both home and school are broken in terms of encouragement, then the chance of the child
									finding the motivation within themselves is slim to none.</p>

								<h1>Service Learning

								</header>
									<p>I completed my service learning project over the course of
									two volunteering tutoring sessions and one community engagement
									project with inner city children at a recreation and learning center. </p>

									<p><div class=image><img src="images/transform.jpg" alt="Transforming Children"></div>
									</br>The first engagement I attended, was the Transforming Children and Families, in which 
									I interacted with children up to the age of 18 that attended schools in 
									the area. I was there to provide insight and perspective on my experiences 
									as a college student, how I got where I am, and what they can do to get 
									there as well. It was really a valuable experience talking to these kids,
									as I do enjoy interacting with children, and watching immediate engagement 
									from many children, as well as slow but sure opening of those that were more shy. 
									They all had genuine interests and I wholly enjoyed fanning those interests and 
									talking in depth with them about what they wanted to do and how they wanted to
									get there, as well as how I've experienced some of these passions in my lifetime.
									This experience both showed the kids that other people do care about their well 
									being and future, outside of their immediate family and friends, and that there
									are people willing to help. </p>
									
									
									
									<p><div class=image><img src="images/page15.jpg" alt="Page 15 Tutoring"></div>
									The next two were at a community project called Page 15 Tutoring, 
									where students from around the area came in after school at different intervals,
									allowing us to help guide them through their various projects and homework assignments
									to be completed. It was enlightening to interact with so many children coming of their 
									own volition to this free tutoring center, that provides computer and internet access, 
									as well as a plethora of books and comics to read. They were all so lively and interested 
									in what they did, and there were gems that shone through as those that have the strive
									to learn as much as they can and were open to the idea of getting help beyond themselves. 
									I really loved every experience I had with all of these children in tutoring and life advice. </p>

								<p>
								From a biological viewpoint, there are numerous ways to approach the situation
								plaguing those in these unfortunate environments. Biology, through status as a 
								natural science establishes it's theories more concretely than that of a subjective science.
								A few of the theories in particular I would look at include: Genetic Predetermination, and 
								environmental impact. According to genetic factors present in certain populations, there can
								exist a predetermined reason for lower chances in a multitude of areas. For this project
								specifically, this pertains to educational success. However, in environmental impact, it argues heavily for
								the surroundings of the child having the largest impact. As observation goes, it would seem that
								environmental impact is the heaviest contributing factor to problems in educational growth
								for children in inner city areas.

								<h1>Sociology</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
								When focusing on a sociological perspective, we see how the whole picture
								comes into focus, pointing out the very important truths of how the whole package of child
								upbringing contributes to their success.  When analyzing the various aspects of a child’s education, 
								it becomes abundantly clear how much of an impact everything has on their lives through their development.
								In the book, “This model stresses that learning, child care, and upbringing are interconnected. Jackson(2007)
								writes: ‘in this model the child is seen as a social being, connected to others and at the same time with his 
								or her own distinctive experiences and knowledge’ (p.18).”. This greatly agrees with the notion of all aspects
								of environment impacting a child’s educational process, and not just that at the curricular level in schools.
								When integrating this idea with the biological processes affected, the sociological impact of home, and school 
								environment, as well as the educational impact of curriculum and teacher interactivity, it makes for a much more
								whole understanding of a child’s needs for education and helps understand the problem at hand plaguing child 
								education, especially at differing levels of society. When compared to inner city children, those in suburbs
								and with better access to loving social situations and materials, it can be seen how much of a disparity between
								the qualities of education is made. This full view understanding of children and the nurturing of all aspects 
								of their life as a step towards a solution of child education is extremely helpful.

								<h1>Education</h1>

								<div class=image><img src="images/inner-city.jpg" width="100%" alt="Inner City Child">

								</br>
								<p>
								Educational perspective centers on the idea of how teaching is approached in all parts of the world,
								and how it can be geared towards the betterment of those being taught.
								From some of my observation, there seems to be a general lack of interest in curriculum provided 
								to young students, especially those in the most unfo0rtunate areas, which leads to a problem with
								motivation of the students themselves, thus lending to the problem of child education at hand. 
								One of the many factors, but every facet of education should be taken into account when trying
								to fix the disparity of proper education for children. As spoken in the book, “In place of the
								docility of the body of the child there was active freedom of movement. In place of hierarchical
								observation there was trusted playfulness. In place of the fostering of teacher authority through
								tests and examinations, documentation, standards and competitiveness, there was wide-ranging 
								individualization, culture of the children’s personalities, and promotion of active creativity”.
								This was pertaining to their explanation of Froebelianism, and how the introduction of more movement,
								play, and general attentiveness to the needs of the children greatly improved their interest and
								thus retention of subjects at hand. This seemingly simple notion to nurture child creativity is 
								greatly lacking in children education around the world, including the states, and especially in 
								inner city. Of course there are a number of reasons more that the curriculum is lacking, but the 
								first step would be geared towards attending to the child instead of the state.

								<p>
								Discussion into the various debilitations that many families face all over the country 
								and world is usually about the same thing. The impoverished state of the neighborhood 
								and societal structure itself has a directly debilitating effect on the educational
								system holding the children up. There needs to be lent a helping hand by all those in a 
								given area, and beyond. There can’t simply be passed blame along the lines of hierarchy,
								it all starts with one person, and the more people that help, the more we can progress
								to a better future with equal opportunity for most. Among the main topics discussed and
								explored, there needs to be a change in the child’s state of mind, the neighborhoods
								and streets they live on, the people they live with, the handling of the system by those 
								in power, the involvement of those in more fortunate circumstances, and the change into
								a more child-centered educational curriculum. These encompass such a large variety of 
								problems and topics it entails an entirely new level of complexity that only an 
								interdisciplinary approach can tackle. Hopefully in the future, with a culmination 
								of a much better understanding of every aspect that is attributed to disadvantaged child students,
								there can be a monumental change in all aspects of their upbringing and surroundings to make way 
								for a better future for all.
